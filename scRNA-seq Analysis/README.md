## Project 1: Complete scRNA-seq Analysis (Emulation of a Nature Publication)
This project aims to replicate and extend the analyses presented in a Nature publication by utilizing the same dataset used in the original study. However, since the paper did not provide the source code, a key challenge will be accurately reconstructing the analyses through data science techniques. The ultimate goal is to validate the findings by comparing my results with those published in the paper.
