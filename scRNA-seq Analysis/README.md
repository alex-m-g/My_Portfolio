# scRNA-seq Analysis

Description: Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data to identify cell populations, gene expression patterns, and biomarkers.
Key Techniques: Dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE), clustering, differential expression analysis.

## Project 1: single-cell Lung Atlas of Lethal COVID-19
This project aims to replicate and extend the analyses presented in a Nature publication by utilizing the same dataset used in the original study. However, since the paper did not provide the source code, a key challenge will be accurately reconstructing the analyses through data science techniques. The ultimate goal is to validate the findings by comparing my results with those published in the paper.
