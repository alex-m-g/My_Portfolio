Title: Columbia University/NYP COVID-19 Lung Atlas
Orgnaism: Homo sapiens
Experiment Type: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing
Summary: We profiled 116,314 cells using snRNA-seq of 20 frozen lungs obtained from 19 COVID-19 decedents and seven control patients with short postmortem interval (PMI) autopsies. The COVID-19 cohort comprises seven female and 12 male decedents, including 13 patients of Hispanic ethnicity, with an age range from 58 to >89 years who had acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection and succumbed to the disease. The average time from symptom onset to death was 27.5 days (range, 4–63 days). After rapid autopsy with a median PMI of 4 hours (range 2–9 hours) collected tissues were either flash-frozen or frozen following OCT (optimal cutting temperature) embedment and subjected to snRNA-seq using a droplet-based platform (10x Genomics). All included patients had underlying hypertensive disorder and frequently one or more additional co-morbidities associated with increased risk for severe COVID-19.
Overall Design: Single-nuclei RNA sequencing of 116,314 cells from 20 frozen lungs obtained from 19 COVID-19 decedents and seven control patients.
