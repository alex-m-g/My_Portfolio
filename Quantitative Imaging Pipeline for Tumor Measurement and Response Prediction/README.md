# Quantitative Imaging Pipeline for Tumor Measurement and Response Prediction

## 1. **Project Overview**
   **Title**: *Quantitative Imaging Pipeline for Tumor Measurement and Response Prediction*
   **Goal**: Develop a pipeline that extracts tumor measurements from medical images (CT, MRI) and builds predictive models for tumor response and toxicity.

## 2. **Project Components**

- **Data Pipeline**
  - Develop tools to curate, preprocess, and store medical image data (DICOM, NIfTI formats).
  - Automate tumor measurement extraction from imaging datasets using Python.
  - Build a standardized platform for storing these extracted features for later analysis.

- **Image Analysis**
  - Apply image processing techniques to identify tumor boundaries (e.g., segmentation using deep learning).
  - Preprocess images (e.g., resizing, normalization) for feeding into machine learning models.

- **Machine Learning Models**
  - Implement machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) to predict tumor response to treatment and toxicity in normal tissues.
  - Use deep learning techniques (e.g., convolutional neural networks) for tumor segmentation and feature extraction.
  - Train and evaluate models using datasets such as TCIA (The Cancer Imaging Archive).

- **Predictive Tools**
  - Build a model that predicts patient outcomes (tumor growth, shrinkage, or toxicity).
  - Include both supervised (e.g., classification/regression) and unsupervised techniques (e.g., clustering) for outcome prediction.

- **Containerization & Scalability**
  - Use Docker to containerize the pipeline, allowing easy deployment on cloud platforms or institutional servers.
  - Implement Kubernetes for orchestration if the pipeline needs scaling.

## 3. **Technologies & Tools**
   - **Programming Languages**: Python (main), MATLAB (optional for image processing).
   - **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow or PyTorch for building CNN models for tumor segmentation.
   - **Imaging Libraries**: SimpleITK, OpenCV, or scikit-image for handling medical image formats and processing.
   - **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn for classical models; PyTorch or TensorFlow for deep learning.
   - **Data Management**: SQL or NoSQL database for managing and storing tumor measurement data.
   - **Containerization**: Docker to containerize your pipeline.
   - **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for managing containerized applications.
   - **Version Control & CI/CD**: GitHub with GitHub Actions for continuous integration.
   - **GPU Acceleration**: C++/CUDA used for model optimization for minimal GPU interference.
   - **Cloud Deployment**: Deply the application pipeline on a cloud platform (AWS, GCP) using Kubernetes clusters.

## 4. **Steps to Start the Project**
###   1. **Set Up the Environment**: Install Python with required libraries (`SimpleITK`, `TensorFlow`, `PyTorch`, `scikit-learn`, etc.). Use your Anaconda environment to manage dependencies.
###   2. **Data Collection**: Use public datasets like TCIA for tumor imaging data. You can start with sample images and annotations for segmentation tasks. Dataset: [MRI Imaging of Pediatric Patients with High-Grade Gliomas: The Cancer Imaging Archive](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/dfci-bch-bwh-peds-hgg/)
###   3. **Build the Data Pipeline**:
- Write Python scripts to automate image loading and preprocessing.
    - [NIfTI Image Processing via Python](https://neuraldatascience.io/8-mri/nifti.html)
- Store extracted tumor measurements in a **MySQL** structured database. 
    - Voxel Intensity Values
    - Tumor Segmentation Labels (If available)
    - Image Metadata
    - Tumor-specific Features
    - Multi-Modal data
    - Clinical Data (if available)
    - Pre-processing information
    - Spatial coordinates
    - Temporal data (if longitudinal)
###   4. **Image Segmentation Model**:
- Implement a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) model to segment tumors. (TensorFlow / PyTorch)

###   5. **Predictive Modeling**:
- Train machine learning models on extracted features to predict patient outcomes.
    - Train the model using Database from (3) and Segmented Tumor data from (4)
- Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, AUC, or F1 score.
###   6. **Containerization**:
- Write Dockerfiles to containerize your pipeline.
- Test deployment locally and ensure all dependencies are included.
###   7. **Scalability with Kubernetes** (optional):
- Use Kubernetes for deploying on a cloud platform if needed for scalability.

## 5. **Extensions & Future Work**
   - Integrate Natural Language Processing (NLP) for extracting relevant clinical data from reports.
   - Explore federated learning to leverage distributed datasets while ensuring patient privacy.
   - Implement explainability methods (e.g., SHAP) to interpret the model's predictions.
